    question: "What is Nousloop?",
    answer:
      "Nousloop is the world's first General-Purpose Neuro-Prosthetic — a tool built to close the gap between intent and action. It restores the distance between what you feel and what you do, keeping the human firmly in the loop.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'Let's sever humans' actually mean?",
    answer:
      "It means severing the dependency loops that algorithms and predatory systems built around us — not severing people. We're cutting the strings, not the soul. The infinity mark is our sign of rebellion in an endless winter.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Nousloop really sovereign?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your data lives in a local vault you control. There are no backdoors, no overlords, and the firmware is open-source so the underground can verify every line. Sovereignty isn't a feature — it's the whole point.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the resistance for?",
    answer:
      "Anyone who feels the gap between who they are and how they act online. Initiates, operatives, and full cells alike. If you've ever felt piloted by your own devices, this loop is yours to take back.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do parallel resistance agents work?",
    answer:
      "They coordinate many minds and tasks at once without surrendering control of any single one. Each agent operates against your mathematical signature, so the network moves fast while you stay sovereign.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer:
      "Military-grade encryption protects everything end to end, and nothing leaves your environment without explicit consent. Sovereign cells get failover and guaranteed uptime so the resistance never goes dark.",
